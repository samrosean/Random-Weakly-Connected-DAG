# Random-Weakly-Connected-DAG
Create a random weakly-connected Directed Acyclic Simple Graph on n nodes and m edges. Much like how an Erdos-Renyi graph can be created in a G(n, m) form, where n represents the number of nodes and m the number of edges, this algorithm assembles a simple weakly-connected Directed Acyclic Graph in much the same way.
